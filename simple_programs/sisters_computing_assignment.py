# 1. Create a class to represent a Cat. This cat can be tame or wild, and it can be alive or dead. The cat also has a name, a certain number of hearts to represent its health, and a certain number of fish in its stomach 
    # Okay, Class = cat ---- Attributes = tame, wild, alive, dead, health, fish 

# 2. You can feed a cat a fish where its health goes up by 1 (maximum 4) and it becomes tame (50%). However, if a cat has more than 3 fish in the stomach, it will become dead and drop health to 0

# 3. You can hit a Cat and make its health go down by 1.5 times (minumum 0). Hitting a Cat, will always make it wild, and sometimes makes it dead when it has 0 hearts 
    # If you hit the cat, the health is going to go down by 1.5 times and every hit makes it wild. And if the cats hearts = 0, then it it'll be dead

# 4. At the end of every night, if a cat is a alive, there will 1 less fish in its stomach. If the number of fish drops to 0, the cat becomes wild. 
 
# 5. Dead cats cannot be fed and don't give gifts
