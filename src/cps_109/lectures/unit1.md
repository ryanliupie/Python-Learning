## Unit 1 

<b>Declarative Knowledge:</b> This is knowing what something is. This can be facts, concepts, and information that can be stated explicitly. For example,  "Toronto is a City in Ontario."

<b>Imperative Knowledge:</b> This is knowledge on steps of how to do something. For example, "1. put clothes in washer. 2. take clothes out of washer and put into dryer."

<hr>

<b>Primitive constructors:</b> These are the building blocks used to make more complex entities that cannot be broken down further. 

<u>English:</u> Dog, Cat, House, Car, ... 
- These are primitive at the "word" level that you can create a more complex entity like a sentence. 

<u>Programming:</u> int, boolean, str, float. 
- These are primitive where you can create algorithms with these specific types. 

<hr>

<b>Static Semantics:</b> This is when a program is syntactically correct and has <i>meaning</i>. This asks us <i>"Does this program make sense before running?"</i> Let's take a look at some examples: 

<u>English:</u> "The pizza ate me". This is syntactically valid, but is a semantic error because it does not make sense. 

<u>Programming:</u> "`"car" + 3`" is a semantic error since this equation does not make sense. 

Once a statement is syntactically correct and passes static semantic checks, then it has <b> Semantics (a meaning)</b>. 

<hr>
 <b>Scalar:</b> These are values that cannot be broken down further and represents one thing. 

 - <u>int:</u> `5` 
- <u>float:</u> `3.67`
 - <u>bool:</u> `true` or `false`
 - <u>NoneType:</u> has one value, `None`

<b>Non-scalar:</b> These are values that contain multiple characters. 

- <u>string:</u> `"ryan"` 
- <u>set:</u> `{4, 5, 6, 7}`
- <u>tuple:</u> `(12, 56, 78)`
- <u>dictionary:</u> `{car: honda, truck: volvo}`   

<hr>
<u><b> Review of Operations</b></u>

- <u> a + b:</u> the sum
- <u> a - b:</u> the difference
- <u> a * b:</u> the product
- <u> a / b:</u> division
- <u> a // b:</u> int division (result is a whole number excluding the remainder)
- <u> a % b:</u> modulo (gives remainder after operation)
- <u> a ** b:</u> the power of a number (a to the power of b)
  
<b>Operator Precedence:</b> These are rules that determine which operations will be performed first in an expression. 

<hr>

Make sure to remember Logical Operators for boolean such as `AND` `OR`, and `NOT`, and how to use Relational Operators such as `==`, `!=`, or even `>`.
